# Master's project

General structure:
* `config/` directory contains configuration information, including the central `config.yml` file.
* `data/` directory contains all the source and processed data.
* `doc/` directory contains documentation material.
* `env/` directory contains conda environments.
* `results/` directory contains results generated by the data analysis code found in `src/`.
* `src/` directory contains all the code to perform the analyses. It is first divided by programming language, then by workflow.

## BEELINE

This project is laregely based on the BEELINE framework for benchmarking of GRN inference methods, with its fork with minor changes available at [szysztof17/Beeline](https://github.com/szysztof17/Beeline), and the original from Murali group is available at [Murali-group/BEELINE](https://github.com/Murali-group/Beeline).


## Some analyses

Files named step 1, 2, 3 in `src/jupyter/` are Jupyter notebooks that perform the main analyses as showcased on Buenrostro 2018 data. Each notebook contains a short description of its purpose.

As a result we obtain a number of datasets prepared for BEELINE analysis, and next step would be (after adjusting the config file to fit our purpose), to:

```
cd BEELINE
python BLRunner.py --config config-files/buenrostro18_config.yaml # and ../src/py/monitor_for_genie_output.py buenrostro18.yaml on some servers to prevent getting stuck
python BLEvaluator.py --config config-files/buenrostro18_config.yaml --epr --auc
``` 

## Figures

Figures for the thesis are generated using scripts found in `figures/scripts`.
